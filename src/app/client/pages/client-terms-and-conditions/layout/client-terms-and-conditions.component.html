			<p class="section-description">
				When a buyer shows interest in a product posted by a supplier on our
				website, the buyer can initiate the contact process by clicking on the
				"Contact Supplier" button available on the product posting. This action
				facilitates direct communication between the buyer and the supplier to
				discuss further details, negotiate terms and potentially proceed with a
				business transaction.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				It is important that buyers use this function in a responsible and
				professional manner. Contact with suppliers should be made with the
				genuine intention of obtaining more information about the product and
				considering a purchase. Any misuse of this feature, such as sending
				unsolicited communications or using information for purposes other than
				commercial purchase, is strictly prohibited.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				Buyers should note that our website facilitates the connection between
				buyers and suppliers, but does not participate in the negotiations or
				transactions resulting from these contacts. Therefore, it is the buyer's
				responsibility to perform due diligence and ensure that they understand
				and agree to the terms of sale, warranty policies, shipping costs and
				any other relevant aspects of the transaction before committing to a
				purchase.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				The buyer agrees that any negotiation and resulting transaction is a
				direct agreement between the buyer and the supplier. Our website is not
				responsible for the accuracy of the information provided by suppliers in
				their postings nor for the quality or delivery of products purchased
				through these contacts.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				In the event of disputes or problems related to a transaction
				originating through the "Contact Supplier" function, it is recommended
				that the buyer and supplier attempt to resolve the matter between
				themselves. Our website does not provide mediation or dispute resolution
				in such situations.

			<p class="section-title">4.3. Sourcing Request (RFQ)</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				Sourcing Request is an online tool designed to facilitate the connection

				access to an extensive network of suppliers from around the world,
				allowing you to receive multiple proposals in a short period of time.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				When you post your RFQ on Sourcing Request, the information is
				automatically distributed to registered suppliers on our platform. In
				addition, your request will remain visible to thousands of other
				suppliers in our directory until you decide to withdraw it. This
				significantly increases your chances of finding the product you need
				efficiently and effectively.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				It is important that you provide detailed and accurate information in
				your RFQ to facilitate appropriate responses from suppliers. This
				includes, but is not limited to, product specifications, quantities
				required, preferred delivery times and any other criteria relevant to
				your need.

			<p class="section-title">5. UNCLAIMED CARGO</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				Unclaimed cargo published in our directory is merchandise that, for
				various reasons, has not been picked up or has been rejected by the
				original consignee. This cargo is not damaged, broken or expired, and
				its unclaimed status is due to specific circumstances. Shippers of such

			<p class="section-description">
				For those users who do not find an offer of interest to them at a given
				time, we offer the option to register on our platform. By doing so, they
				will receive email notifications when new offers are published that may
				match their interests or needs.

			<p class="section-description">
				Users agree that any transaction made through the contact established in
				our directory is their full responsibility. Our website and its
				operators are not responsible for the results of such transactions,

			<p class="section-description">
				You acknowledge and agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
				out of or relating to these terms and conditions, whether for breach,
				termination, performance, interpretation or validity, as well as any
				aspect of your use of our website, shall preferably be resolved by
				binding arbitration between you and Globy. However, the right of both

				if they deem it necessary remains.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				In the event of any dispute arising in connection with your use of the
				website or breach of these terms and conditions, both parties agree to
				seek resolution through an arbitration process. This process will be
				conducted before a recognized and respected arbitration entity, selected
				by mutual agreement of both parties and following the applicable
				commercial arbitration rules.
			</p>
			<p class="section-description">
				In addition, the user agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
				not to initiate, join or participate in class action lawsuits associated
				with any claim, dispute or controversy that may arise in connection with
				the use of the website. This commitment seeks to promote a more agile
				and personalized resolution of any conflict, favoring arbitration and
				individual legal actions over class actions.
